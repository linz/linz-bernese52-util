# Can include {yyyy},{yy},{mmmm}, {mmm},{mm},{ddd},{dd} which will map to 
# the corresponding date strings (mmm is 3 letter month name, mmmm is the 
# full month name). Will also accept Mmm, MMM, Mmmm, MMMM for different 
# capitalisation.

# Also can accept {code} or {CODE} for upper or lower case four character
# codes which will match a valid code. Use {Code} for a case insensitive
# code match.
# 
# These will be replaced with values corresponding to the maximum number
# of days before the current date to process.  Can also include ? for any
# character, and * for any set of characters.

# RemoteFileRe.  Remote file names are matched against this regular expression.

# Marker file.  By default the script checks for the existence of the target 
# file.  If it exists and is of the correct size it is downloaded again.  The 
# script can instead use a marker file into which the downloaded size is written.
# This allows the downloaded file to be removed or otherwise changed without 
# being reprocessed.

# Processing script. Command to run once a file has been downloaded.  The script
# is run in the target directory.  The command can include parameters, and can
# include the replacement strings for filename, code, etc.
#
# If PostDownloadCommandChDir evaluates to true then the script changes to the 
# download directory to execute the command.
