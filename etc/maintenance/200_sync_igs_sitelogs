# Also can accept {code} or {CODE} for upper or lower case four character
# codes which will match a valid code. Use {Code} for a case insensitive
# code match.

# These will be replaced with values corresponding to the maximum number
# of days before the current date to process.  Can also include ? for any

# Local base directory.  All files downloaded or created by subsequent scripts
# should be subdirectories of this directory. Use ~ for the directory in which
# the configuration script is located.  This is not used if the target is an S3
# bucket.  However the script will create a temporary local directory for retrieving
# and processing files prior to uploading to S3. 
#
# All local filenames below are relative to this (or on S3, relative to the S3 prefix)

# If an S3 bucket is defined then files are installed into the bucket using the 
# file structure relative to the LocalBaseDirectory.  The file names can be prefixed

# are as used by the LINZ::GNSS::AwsS3Bucket module.

# Marker file.  By default the script checks for the existence of the target 
# file.  If it exists and is of the correct size it is downloaded again.  The 
# script can instead use a marker file into which the downloaded size is written.
# This allows the downloaded file to be removed or otherwise changed without 
# being reprocessed.

#MarkerPath=~/{yyyy}/{ddd}/{filename}.downloaded

# Processing script. Command to run once a file has been downloaded.  The script
# is run in the target directory.  The command can include parameters, and can
# include the replacement strings for filename, code, etc.
#
# If PostDownloadCommandChDir evaluates to true then the script changes to the 
# download directory to execute the command.

# Codes to download.  Use Codes * (or omit codes altogether), to download
