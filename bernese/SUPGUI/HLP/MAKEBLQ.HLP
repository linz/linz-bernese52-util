<b>CREATE OCEAN LOADING FILE</b>
<p>Program: MAKEBLQ</p>
</center>

<hr width="100%">
<p><b>GENERAL DESCRIPTION</b></p>
<p>
The MAKEBLQ program compiles a BLQ ocean loading file for the stations 
in a coordinate file.  
It uses two input files from the datapool.  
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Template file: A file of specific stations that have already been computed.  
This file also serves as the template for the file that is created (the
header from this file is used).  Stations with names/codes matching this
file will use the coefficients in this file provided their coordinates
are sufficiently close to those used in the file.
</li>
<li>
Grid file: A file of gridded ocean loading coefficients.  
The grid does not need to be complete, but all the points in the file need to 
be on a regular latitude and longitude grid.  These values are used to 
interpolate the coefficients for stations which
are not found in the template file.  A station will be interpolated 
if coefficients are defined for the four corners of the grid cell in which
it lies.
</li>
</ul>

<p><b>CREATE OCEAN LOADING FILE</b></p>

<a name="TITLE" default="Test"></a>
<p><b>Title</b>
The title to be used on program output.
</p>

<a name="BLQSRC" default=""></a>
<p><b>Template/station source ocean loading file</b>
The name of the template file used to provide the header for the output
BLQ file, and from which pre-calculated stations may be loaded.  The file
must be located in the datapool directory.
</p>

<a name="BLQGRD" default=""></a>
<p><b>Ocean loading grid file</b>
The name of the file of gridded ocean loading coefficients. This file must 
be located in the datapool directory.
</p>

<a name="CRDFILE" default=""></a>
<p><b>Input coordinate file</b>
The coordinate file containing the stations at which ocean loading values are
to be calculated.
</p>

<a name="CRDTOL" default="100.0"></a>
<p><b>Position tolerance for matched stations</b>
Specifies the maximum horizontal offset between a station in the 
coordinate file and a proposed matching station in the template file.
If the difference is greater than this the station in the template file
will be assumed to refer to another mark and the coefficients will not 
be used.
</p>

<a name="BLQTRGT" default="0"></a>
<p><b>Output ocean loading file</b>
The name of the ocean loading BLQ file to create.  This file will be located
in the campaign STA directory.
</p>

<a name="SYSODEF" default="1"></a>
<a name="SYSOUT"  default="CRDMERGE"></a>
<p><b>GENERAL OUTPUT FILES</b>
<p><b>Program output:</b>
You can choose to have the program output written to a separate file for each
program run (checkbox marked), or specify a common name for all program runs.
<br>
If you mark the checkbox, the filename will correspond to the program name
with an extension containing a counter (Lnn), which is automatically
incremented for each program run. If the counter reaches the maximum value, it
is automatically reset, and existing files will be overwritten.
The maximum value can be set in
<b>Menu &gt; Configure &gt; Program Names</b>, option "Maximum program output
file number".
<br>
If the checkbox is unmarked, you have to specify a name for the program
output file. This allows to characterize the program run, e.g., by using the
day and year (<tt>$YD+0</tt>) in the filename.
</p>

<a name="ERRMRG" default="0"></a>
<a name="SYSERR" default="ERROR"></a>
<p><b>Error messages:</b>
You can choose to have error messages written into the program's output
file (see above), or specify a separate file to which error messages are
written.
