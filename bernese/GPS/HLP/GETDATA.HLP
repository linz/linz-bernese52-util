<b>DOWNLOAD REFERENCE DATA</b>
<p>Program: GETDATA</p>
</center>

<hr width="100%">
<p><b>GENERAL DESCRIPTION</b></p>
<p>
The GETDATA program can be used to retrieve GPS reference data 
such as orbit parameters, earth rotation parameters, and reference station 
RINEX data from pre-configured data centres and install it into the current
campaign directories.
</p><p>
The available data centres are
defined in a configuration file (getdata.conf) located by default in /etc/bernese52 
on LINUX systems.
</p><p>
The configuration also defines a file cache into which the data are saved.  This is 
colocated with the bernese datapool though currently the file structure does not exactly
match that used by the Bernese tools.  When files are requested the script will look first 
in the file cache, and then attempt to retrieve the data from the data centres if not available.
The data centres are prioritized, and the data will be taken from the first prioritized centre 
in which it is available.
</p><p>
Each data type has an associated latency.  Before retrieving data the script will check whether 
the data should be available, and if it is not due yet the script will fail without trying.
</p><p>
The data centres each support a set of file types (eg orbits, ERP, RINEX), and a set of stations.
Each file type also has prioritized subtypes.  For example orbits may be FINAL, RAPID, or ULTRA.
</p><p>
The getdata scripts also support queuing data for later downloads, though at present this 
is not implemented completely.  
</p>

<p><b>GETDATA 1: General Options</b></p>

<a name="TITLE" default="Test"></a>
<p><b>TITLE</b>
The title for the data request that will be used in outputs.
</p>

<a name="DNLDNOW" default="1"></a>
<p><b>Try to download now if not in datapool</b>
If selected the program will try to download immediately if data not in the cache.  
Otherwise the data will only be retrieved if it is already cached.
</p>

<a name="QUEUE" default="0"></a>
<p><b>Queue for download if not in datapool or downloaded</b>
If this is selected and the data is not retrieved then it will be added to a queue of 
required data.  At present this option is not properly supported.
</p>


<a name="LISTCFG" default="0"></a>
<p><b>List the reference data sources configuration in the output</b>
If this option is selected then output listing will include the list of configured
data centres and the file types and stations that they support.
</p>

<a name="LISTSTA" default="0"></a>
<p><b>Include a list of available reference stations in the output</b>
Include a list of potential reference stations in the output file. 
</p>

<a name="LOCKFILE" default=""></a>
<p><b>Lock/wait file</b>
The lock file can be used to manage data downloads in a PCF (eg the PositioNZ-PP RUN_PNZ PCF).  
It is created when data is not yet available but is expected to become available.  
The file modification date is set to the expected due date for the data - this can be tested in
scripts to determine whether the data was downloaded and if not when it is expected.
If the script generates a lock file then it will not generate an error in a PCF.
</p>


<a name="SYSODEF" default="1"></a>
<a name="SYSOUT"  default="CRDMERGE"></a>
<p><b>GENERAL OUTPUT FILES</b>
<p><b>Program output:</b>
You can choose to have the program output written to a separate file for each
program run (checkbox marked), or specify a common name for all program runs.
<br>
If you mark the checkbox, the filename will correspond to the program name
with an extension containing a counter (Lnn), which is automatically
incremented for each program run. If the counter reaches the maximum value, it
is automatically reset, and existing files will be overwritten.
The maximum value can be set in
<b>Menu &gt; Configure &gt; Program Names</b>, option "Maximum program output
file number".
<br>
If the checkbox is unmarked, you have to specify a name for the program
output file. This allows to characterize the program run, e.g., by using the
day and year (<tt>$YD+0</tt>) in the filename.
</p>

<a name="ERRMRG" default="0"></a>
<a name="SYSERR" default="ERROR"></a>
<p><b>Error messages:</b>
You can choose to have error messages written into the program's output
file (see above), or specify a separate file to which error messages are
written.
</p>


<p><hr /></p>
<p><b>GETDATA 2: Orbit/ERP/DCB Data</b></p>

<p>
Orbit and earth rotation parameters support three data subtypes - FINAL, RAPID and ULTRA
(ultra-rapid).  The script also supports ULTRA+, and RAPID+, which request the best available 
type at least as good as ULTRA or RAPID respectively at the time the script is run.
</p>

<p>
Also this panel allows downloading of the CODE montly DCB files.  The biases available are 
P1C1 (GPS only) and P1P2 (GPS and GLONASS).

<p><b>GETDATA 3: Bernese atmospheric files and VMF</b></p>

<p>
Atmospheric models (troposphere and ionosphere) are products generated by CODE from their
processing of the global IGS network.  
</p>

<p>
VMF models are gridded models of the atmospheric delay generated every six hours by GGOS
(the Global Geodetic Observing System).  These are generated at the Vienna University of 
Technology.  From their website: 
</p>
<blockquote> 
&quot;Within the project GGOS Atmosphere, we provide hydrostatic and wet zenith delays together with the coefficients of the so-called Vienna Mapping Functions (VMF1) which map the zenith delays to lower elevation angles. These parameters are provided on a global grid (2.5 time 2.0 degrees in longitude and latitude, respectively) every six hours, which is the usual time resolution of ECMWF data, and we also determine these parameters for selected VLBI, and GNSS sites.&quot;
</blockquote>

<p><b>GETDATA 4: Reference Station Data</b></p>

<p>Reference station RINEX data can be downloaded.  There are two &quot;data quality&quot; subtypes,
DAILY and HOURLY.  DAILY data are preferred by the script.
</p>

<a name="DNLDRS_0" default="1"></a>
<a name="DNLDRS_C" default="0"></a>
<a name="REFSTNS" default=""></a>
<a name="DNLDRS_F" default="0"></a>
<a name="DNLDRS_A" default="0"></a>

<p>
There are three different methods for selecting stations to download:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Download station observation data for specified stations</b>
This is the simplest option - the required station four character codes are specified and 
these stations will be downloaded.  Many stations can be requested at the same time - the 
codes must be separated by spaces (eg &quot;MAST WELL&quot;).
</li>
<li>
<b>Download station observation data for stations in coord file</b>
Data will be retrieved for all the stations in the specified coordinate file, 
or just for the stations with a specified flag value.  
</li>
<li>
<b>Automatically select reference stations based on existing coords</b>
This is the most complex option.  It implements the PositioNZ-PP reference station selection 
algorithm.  This uses a reference coordinate from the coordinate file, and based on that
selects the reference stations to use.  The selection is based on a combination of distance and 
geometry - nearby stations are favoured, and stations that are in a different direction to 
already chosen reference stations are selected.  If there is not data available for the 
selected station then the script will try another (unless the data is not yet due, in which case
the script will stop).
</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Downloading based on a coordinate file</b></p>

<a name="IFFLAG" default="0"></a>
<a name="STAFLAG" default=""></a>
<p><b>Only stations with flag</b>The station coordinate file to use is defined below.  Each station in the file can have a
single character &quot;flag&quot; set.  These can be used to select stations to download data for.
More than one flag value can be requested - each should be separated by spaces.  If no flags are 
specified then all stations are used.
</p>

<p><b>Automatic selection of stations</b></p>
<p>
Automatically select reference stations based on station coordinate using the PositioNZ-PP
reference station selection algorithm.  Note that candidate stations must both be available in a
data centre, and must have a station prediction model that can be used to calculate the coordinate
of the mark at the epoch of the current campaign.  Station prediction models are stored in 
the datapool at a location defined by the getdata configuration file.  The configuration file also
defines the weighting scheme used for the station selection algorithm.
</p><p>
This option uses the following parameters
</p>

<ul>

<a name="STACODE" default="U001"></a>
<li><b>Code of mark to base selection on</b>
Define station whose coordinate is used to select reference stations.  The coordinate
is taken from the coordinate file (defined below).  If no coordinate is defined then 
the centroid of all the coordinates in the coordinate file is used.
</li>

<a name="NSTASEL" default="3"></a>
<li><b>Number of marks to select</b>
Specifies the number of reference stations required.
</li>

<a name="MINDATA" default="90"></a>
<li><b>Minimum percentage of data reqd</b>
The downloaded RINEX data is tested to ensure that there is not missing data during the session. 
This option sets the minimum coverage required - if the data cannot provide this then the 
reference station will not bu used..
</li>

<a name="MAXDLY" default="3"></a>
<li><b>Maximum no delayed stations</b>
Stations which are not available for download are considered delayed rather than unavailable 
for a configurable period after they are due. By default the script will fail in with a wait 
status for these stations, but it can ignore a certain number before assuming that there is a 
systematic problem and stopping. This setting specifies that number.
</li>

<a name="UPDTCRD" default="1"></a>
<li><b>Add/update marks in coordfile</b>
Use this option to update the coordinate file to include the reference stations. The coordinates 
are determined from the station coordinate prediction models at the epoch of the campaign (ie the middle of the session).
</li>

<a name="UPDTFLAG" default="I"></a>
<li><b>Flag for updated coordinates</b>
If the coordinates are updated then this defines a flag that will be used for the new coordinates.
</li>

<a name="RFSTFL" default="${P}/PNZPP277/STA/REFSTN.FIX"></a>
<li><b>Reference station list file</b>
The program can write a file containing a list of the reference stations that have been selected.
This is mainly for use in PCFs to select these files for further processing (eg for constraining
in a final solution).  
</li>

</ul>

<p><b>Common options</b></p>

<a name="CRDFILE" default=""></a>
<p><b>Station coordinate file</b>
Defines the name of the station coordinate file from which station codes and coordinates may 
be read, and to which reference station coordinates may be written.
</p>

<a name="MAXMSSTN" default="0"></a>
<p><b>Maximum number of missing stations</b>
Specifies the maximum number of missing stations that will be tolerated before the script fails.
This is for use in PCF downloads where it is possible that a few stations may be offline on a given
day but the PCF should proceed anyway.  This option only applies for downloading lists of stations and 
stations in coordinate files.  The automatic station selection routine will skip unavailable stations 
until it retrieves the required number of stations.
</p>

<a name="RSDTYPE" default="DAILY"></a>
<p><b>RINEX data type</b>
This option is used to select DAILY or HOURLY files.  Also HOURLY+ can be used to select DAILY files
if they are available, otherwise use HOURLY files.
</p>

<a name="MRGRINEX" default="1"></a>
<p><b>Merge RINEX files to session file</b>
Merges all RINEX files downloaded for each reference station, and filters to only include 
observations from the session.
Where a session span more than one UTC day, or where hourly files are used,
more than one RINEX file may be downloaded for each station.  This option merges the data from the 
downloaded files to generate one file per station.  It also filters the data to only include
the campaign session - this may apply even if only one file is downloaded for a station..
</p>

<a name="FIXRINEX" default="1"></a>
<p><b>Fix invalid RINEX antenna/receive</b>
Replace invalid antenna/receivers in RINEX file with best guess valid values.  This ensures that
the antenna and receiver names in the file match valid values in the Bernese antenna and receiver 
files.  The list of valid names is restricted to only include antennae calibrated for dual
frequency GPS data, and receivers capable of receiving dual frequency GPS data.
