     IERS DOMES Number        : 10332M001
     CDP Number               : 
     Date Installed           : 29 MAY 2000
     Geologic Characteristic  : 
       Bedrock Type           : 
       Bedrock Condition      : 
       Fracture Spacing       : 
       Notes                  : Geology is being researched
     Additional Information   : a. The Four Character ID has not yet been
approved
                                   By IGSCB.
                                b. The monument is on the roof of Building
B, which 
                                   is approximately 30 m square and has
four storeys.
                                   The building is constructed of concrete
elements 
                                   with a cast-in-situ concrete roof. The
monument 
                                   is firmly secured to the roof casting
and will 
                                   only suffer movement due to the annual
spring 
                                   thaw if the whole building moves.

Notes:  a. BCR, L1 and L2 measurements as supplied by 
           Ashtech Europe Ltd.
        b. BCR measurement is checked separately.
        c. Measurement to top of radome is no better than +/- 5 mm.
        d. Physical check height-over-monument measurements are to BCR
        e. We do not consider it advisable to remove the radome and can
           therefore not provide a TCR measurement.
